Technical interview simulation excercise for Q42

How it works in short: <br>
I start of with pre defined groups of strings that represent each possible equation with varying parenthesis <br>
Those groups are used to form each possible variation of those groups with each possible variation of numbers <br>
I then do the same for the operators until i have every possible equations <br>
From that point I check which equations are equal to the required value <br>
Every correct equation gets added to an array and printed at the end.
